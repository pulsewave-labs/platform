# 2026-02-19 — Ad Creatives + Email Signals

## Playbook Pages Redesigned (evening session)
- **Opt-in page** (`/playbook`): rebuilt with separate mobile/desktop layouts
  - Mobile: everything above the fold — compact headline, stats row, bare form (no card wrapper), avatar strip
  - Desktop: 2-column (copy left, glassmorphic form card right)
  - Commit `f96b2a4`
- **Advertorial** (`/playbook/read`): full editorial overhaul
  - 680px column, Newsreader serif headings, 17px/1.85 body text
  - Consistent chapter pattern: mono label + serif title

  - Position sizing table, 4-col stats grid, alternating detail rows
  - Reveal scroll animations, 2px progress bar, compact nav
  - Commit `1ad0bbe`
- Both deployed & promoted to www.pulsewavelabs.io

## Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image Gen)
- Learned full Gemini image generation API docs from Mason
- Reference saved: `skills/nano-banana-pro/REFERENCE.md`
- **Always use `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`** — never Flash
- API key: set via env `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- Supports up to 14 reference images, 1K/2K/4K output, thinking mode, Google Search grounding
- REST endpoint: `generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-3-pro-image-preview:generateContent`
- Config: `responseModalities: ["IMAGE"]`, `imageConfig: { aspectRatio, imageSize }` (uppercase K required)

## PulseWave Ad Creatives — 42 Total Generated
- All saved in `content/ads/`
- V1 style (premium dark fintech, glass-morphism, ambient glow) was Mason's preferred aesthetic
- V2 (Apple minimal, pure black) was too stripped back — Mason didn't like
- V3 = V1 style + structured layout (Headline → Subheadline → Visual → CTA) + sharper copy = winner
- **No logo/website on later creatives** per Mason's request
- Terminal-themed creatives (37-42) matched the site vibe well

### Creative angles that worked:
- Anti-scam/transparency ("Trust Me Bro", "Cherry-picked screenshots", "90%")
- Contrarian ("We lose 60% of our trades")
- FOMO/automation ("While you slept", "4:17 AM", "Missed 3 trades")
- Simplicity ("Copy 5 numbers", "30 seconds")
- Terminal/CLI styled (scanning, boot sequence, help command, you vs engine)
- Pain ("Your emotions cost you money", "Stop staring at charts")
- Day job angle ("You work 9-5, market works 24/7") — Mason liked, made 3 variations

### Ad copy decided:
- **Primary text**: Anti-scam transparency angle (90% of signal services...)
- **Headline**: "Every trade. Even the losses."
- Mason wants specific copy to help Meta targeting algorithm

## PulseWave Pricing Update
- Signal bot is **$149/mo** (not $97 as previously noted) or **$1,490/year**
- Do NOT mention pricing in ad creatives

## Email Signal Delivery — Built & Ready to Deploy
- Signal email template: `app/web/lib/emails/signal.ts` — dark premium design matching site
- Email send function added to `lib/emails/send.ts` (sendSignalEmail via Resend API)
- Broadcaster updated: `engine/live/broadcaster.js` — now sends Telegram AND email
- New API: `api/profile/email-signals/route.ts` — PATCH toggle
- Settings page updated with EMAIL SIGNALS toggle section (on by default)
- Telegram link GET endpoint now returns `email_signals` field
- Migration: `supabase/migration-email-signals.sql` — adds `email_signals` boolean default true
- Email from address: `signals@system.pulsewavelabs.io` (needs Resend verification)
- Position sizing table included in emails ($1K-$50K accounts)
- Rate limited: 120ms between emails for Resend
- **On by default** — users get signals even without Telegram connected

## Post-Checkout Onboarding — `/welcome`
- 3-step wizard: Welcome → Notifications → Ready
- Step 2: Connect Telegram (recommended) + email toggle (default on)
- Step 3: Pro tips + dashboard CTA
- Files: `web/app/welcome/page.tsx`, `web/app/welcome/client-page.tsx`
- Mason needs to set Whop redirect URL to `pulsewavelabs.io/welcome`

## PulseWave Indicator Landing Page — `/indicator`
- Rebuilt from go.pulsewaveindicator.com onto pulsewavelabs.io
- Product: TradingView S/R indicator, **$87 lifetime**, 30-day guarantee
- Whop checkout: `https://whop.com/checkout/plan_LFA5ev192mjHb`
- VSL from Converte.ai player embedded
- Files: `web/app/indicator/page.tsx`, `web/app/indicator/client-page.tsx`
- Multiple iterations done:
  1. Initial build (commit pushed)
  2. Redesign: no emojis, SVG icons, numbered badges (commit `20af6d8`)
  3. **Major overhaul** (commit `5fa5a51`): scroll animations, before/after section, "Your chart already has the answer. See it." hero, member count (347), scarcity (500 cap), dot-grid bg, darker base (#06060a), 3-col reviews, inline price comparisons, Mason creator quote, FAQ accordion with plus-to-x
- Vercel deployments needed manual promotion (`Target: None` issue) — use alias API to promote

## Vercel Deployment Notes
- Auto-deploy from GitHub sometimes doesn't promote to production
- Manual deploy: `POST /v13/deployments` with gitSource
- Manual promote: `POST /v13/deployments/{id}/aliases` with `{"alias":"www.pulsewavelabs.io"}`
- Project: `platform-web`, ID: `prj_dlit1Wzzf1bi0fLgURjwpSfvMqh1`

## Ad Performance Context
- PulseWave Indicator: 1.59 ROAS on $819 spend
- PulseWave Signals: just launched, no spend data yet
- Need to point indicator ads to `pulsewavelabs.io/indicator` instead of old Lovable site

## Next Steps
- Mason to set Whop redirect → `pulsewavelabs.io/welcome`
- Point indicator ads to new `/indicator` page
- Set up retargeting for non-converters
- Email capture / lead magnet for nurture sequences
- Baseline conversion data before testing $1 trial
- Annual plan push after 1-2 months

## Evening Session — Auth Pages & Onboarding Rebuild

### Branded Auth Pages (commit `e9b1b05`)
- **`/auth/set-password`** — new page for first-time users to set password (created via Whop webhook)
- **`/auth/reset-password`** — rebuilt from GitHub-esque style to match site (dark fintech)
- **`/auth/forgot-password`** — rebuilt, sends reset link via Supabase, clean minimal design
- All three: black bg, Inter/JetBrains Mono, `#00e5a0` accents, password strength meter, show/hide toggle

### Webhook Updates
- `ensureUser()` now returns `{ id, setPasswordUrl? }` instead of just `id`
- Generates Supabase `recovery` link (not `magiclink`) on new user creation
- Passes `setPasswordUrl` into welcome email template

### Welcome Email Update
- `welcomeEmailHtml()` now accepts optional `setPasswordUrl` param
- Shows highlighted "Set Your Password →" card with green border as first item (only for new users)
- Card includes `✦` icon, descriptive text, and green CTA button linking to `/auth/set-password`

### Welcome/Onboarding Page Rebuild (commit `2af10d1`)
- Ditched 3-step wizard — now single page with 3 cards all visible
- Adapts to logged-in vs not-logged-in state:
  - **Not logged in**: Card 1 highlights "check your email", Telegram says "set password first", bottom shows "Open Gmail" button
  - **Logged in**: Card 1 shows green dot "Signed in as...", Telegram connect works, bottom shows "Open Dashboard"
- Card 1 (password) has green border for visual priority
- Card 3 (email signals) just shows "ON" badge — no action needed
- Uses Tailwind now (was all inline styles before)

### Full New Customer Flow
1. Homepage → Whop checkout → pays
2. Whop fires `membership_activated` webhook
3. Webhook: creates Supabase user + profile, generates recovery link, sends welcome email with "Set Password" button
4. Whop redirects to `/welcome` (not logged in state)
5. User sees "Check your email" prompt
6. Clicks email link → `/auth/set-password` → sets password → redirects to `/welcome` (now logged in)
7. Connects Telegram → Opens Dashboard

### Still Blocked on Mason
- Run `supabase/migration-leads.sql`
- Set Whop redirect URL to `https://www.pulsewavelabs.io/welcome`
- Set Whop webhook URL to `https://www.pulsewavelabs.io/api/whop/webhook`
- Enable Whop webhook events
- In Supabase: add `/auth/set-password` and `/auth/reset-password` to redirect allow list
